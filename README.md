Created a small Proof of Concept to showcase service-oriented architecture and dependency injection for handling data and its re-usability.
Using Separation of Concerns and Strict typing to guarantee data structure, I created a weather service, a weather component, 
a weather utility class to keep the base weather service clean (using this to store the conversion functions and other misc weather-related functions),
and a weather-data and weather-item interface,
